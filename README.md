# PyGuardian

CLI-based app for requesting tabulated character information from the Bungie API. You'll need a Bungie API key for this, just pop it into the constants file

## Run with:

> python destiny_cli.py < playerID > < platform > < eq/stats/playtime/last/vault/valut-name/vault-type/vault-tier >

## Things I want to do

* Dockerize it

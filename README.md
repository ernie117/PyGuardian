# PyGuardian

Soon-to-be python package for requesting tabulated character information from the Bungie API. You'll need a Bungie API key for this, set as environmental variable "BUNGIE_API".

## Run with:

In the top-level directory:

> python -m PyGuardian < playerID > < platform > < eq/stats/playtime/last/vault/vault-name/vault-type/vault-tier >

## Things I want to do

* Write a setup.py
* Turn this into a fully-fledged python package
* Refactor get_manifest.py into class structure
